[Verse 1]
They bring him to the shore
His ship is ready made
He will not see them anymore
Here he cannot stay

The brotherhood is gathered
Their faces hard as stone
They have come to take farewell
In silence they mourn

[Verse 2]
"Our king has left our ranks
A wise and noble man
We owe him loyalty and thanks
He ruled with a steady hand

He will be missed by all
His heart has now been stilled
Tonight he'll dine in Odin's Hall
There he'll drink his fill"
